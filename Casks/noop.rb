  caveats "NOOP ships anonymously and is unsigned (no Apple Developer ID), so on first launch macOS Gatekeeper will block it. On macOS 15 Sequoia and later: try to open NOOP once, then go to System Settings > Privacy & Security, scroll down, and click 'Open Anyway' next to NOOP. (On macOS 14 and earlier you can right-click NOOP in /Applications and choose Open.) Update later with: brew upgrade --cask noop."
